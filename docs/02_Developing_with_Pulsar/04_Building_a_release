Our sofware (CMP, Zodyac, Weejot) consume a 'built' version of pulsar which is contained within the `/dist` directory.

The contents of `/dist` should reflect the current state of the latest stable release on the master branch.

To build a new release, you can run the following grunt command **on the master branch**:

	$ grunt build

This will perform the following tasks:

 * Run tests
 * Compile Sass files to CSS
 * Minify all pulsar specific javascript into a single file
 * Copy all libs, fonts, docs and images to `/dist`
 * Commit changes with message 'Release vx.x.x'
 * Tag branch with 'x.x.x'
 * Push to remote origin

The layout of `/dist` is:

	dist/
	 ├── css/
	 ├── docs/
	 ├── fonts/
	 ├── images/
	 ├── js/
	 ├── libs/
