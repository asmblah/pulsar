The language you use in error messages is critically important, perhaps more so that nay other type of message we will give to a user. Your message message will often be displayed to a confused, stressed and frustrated user who probably doesn't immediately know what has caused the message.

* Be straightforward. Explain what's going on right away
* Be calm, don't use exclamation marks or alarming words like ‘alert’ or ‘immediately’
* Be serious. Don't joke around with frustrated people
* Where possible, accept blame on behalf of the user (use ‘we’ instead of ‘you’)
* If possible, offer a solution or next step
