All Pulsar UI interfaces should use clear English with correct grammar and punctuaton.

### Title Case

Some interface elements should use title case which capitalises the major words (conjunctions, articles and prepositions are considered minor words).

_**T**his is an **E**xample of **T**itle **C**ase._

The following interface elements should use title case:

* Buttons
* Page, Deck, Modal, Popover titles
* Table headers

### Sentence Case

Use sentence case for everything else, including:

_**T**his is an example of sentence case._

* Breadcrumb items
* Action menu items
* Tab labels
* Form labels and help text
* Navigation links
