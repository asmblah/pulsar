A question I'm still asked, by Jadugars old and new:

So, what exactly *is* Pulsar?

I understand why it's still a difficult concept to grasp, as there's so many facets to pulsar, so I felt it was important to try and make some sense and explain some of the different things that are being worked on inside the Pulsar. At first, I tried to explain pulsar in a sentence:

"Pulsar is a robust user-interface framework with a collection of patterns, helpers and a user-focused design process with documented best practices that will help you to make beautiful user interfaces and beautiful user experiences."

This isn't bad, but it still fails to really clarify what it means to 'make it pulsar', it really only started to make sense when I split pulsar into two separate components.

# Pulsar UI & Pulsar UX 

*Beautiful software. Beautiful experience.*

### Pulsar UI (the design system)

 * The html
 * The css
 * The javascript
 * The layouts
 * The helpers
 * The patterns
 * The documentation
 * The styleguide

### Pulsar UX (the design process)

 * The research
 * The wireframing
 * The sketching
 * The prototyping
 * The interaction design
 * The testing
 * The iteration and constant improvement
 
# Goals

### Pulsar UI

 * Improve UI code and consistency
 * Create less markup
 * Enable engineers to prototype in hours, not days
 * Allow the rapid release of UI improvements
 * Provide a common UI language (The lexicon) to help new Jadugars learn our lingo
 * Provide a starting point to redesign older parts of the software
 * Make our interfaces more testable

### Pulsar UX

 * Make our customers happier
 * Learn how our customers use our software
 * Know exactly what our customers need (not necessarily what they ask for), so that we can build the right thing
 * Reduce the complexity of the tasks our customers need to perform
 * Define clear, understandable requirements for engineers to build awesome things
